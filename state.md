# State

## Current Status
System is live and in production.

## Active Spreadsheets
- Main 2026 spreadsheet (`GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`) — Orders tab being written as always
- Delivery tracking spreadsheet (`DELIVERY_SHEET_ID`) — DLVR tabs being written as always
- Route 25252 spreadsheet (`SHEET_ID_25252`) — newly added, writes to "Restaurant_Data" tab
- Route 25248 spreadsheet (`SHEET_ID_25248`) — newly added, writes to "Restaurant_Data" tab

## Recent Changes
- Added support for route-specific spreadsheets (25252 and 25248). When an order comes in for a customer on route 25252 or 25248, the system now also writes to those dedicated sheets in addition to the main spreadsheet. No existing behavior was changed — these are purely additive writes.

## Known Issues / In Progress
- None currently noted
